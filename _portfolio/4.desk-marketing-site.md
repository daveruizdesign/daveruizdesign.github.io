I was recruited to redesign the desk.com Business Insights platform, but there were so many interesting projects that we just kept going. I lead the marketing site redesign efforts and created desk.com’s mobile app. I’m currently at Service Cloud (desk.com’s bigger sibling) designing their mobile case management app.
