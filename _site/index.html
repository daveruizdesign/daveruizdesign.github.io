						<p>Mixpanel enlisted me to work with their team of extremely talented UX Designers to help redesign the core product’s analytics interface.  This opportunity taught me a ton about user experience and how data is visualized. To log into Mixpanel now and still see our solutions in use reassures me that the UX we created was top notch.</p>

Running my own creative shop exposed me to all the different elements of the process, from client interaction, right through to implementation and product launch.</p>
